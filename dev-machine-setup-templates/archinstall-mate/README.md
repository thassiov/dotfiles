# archinstall templates

[archinstall](https://github.com/archlinux/archinstall)

These json files are to be run when setting up a arch system from scratch.

```sh
 archinstall --config ./user_configuration.json --creds ./user_credentials.json
```

The credentials file has root and the first user (thassiov) with the password "secure".
The password needs to be changed after the installation is done.
